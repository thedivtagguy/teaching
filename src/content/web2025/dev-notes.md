# Dev Notes

Dev notes are your personal log of what you're building, learning, and figuring out. Think of them as a mix between a technical journal and a quick project update. For the purposes of this course, we'll be logging our dev notes on Github Issues. This will help us both "learn in public" and track progress as a community. 

All of us have such unique perspectives and it is worth of being shared with each other. 

## Basic Structure

**Date + What you're working on**

```
## March 15 â€” Making a menu section
```

**What happened today**

- What you made or tried to make. This might not always be an artifact.
- What you learned or figured out
- What annoyed you
- Cool stuff you found

**Links and screenshots** Save anything useful you found. Screenshots of your work, error messages you conquered, or just something that looked neat.

Write like you're texting a friend about your day. Use "I" and be specific about what actually happened. "I spent 3 hours trying to understand how use CSS to create a blinking animation" is more useful than "worked on CSS"

Don't worry about being formal or perfect. Some days you'll write paragraphs, other days just bullet points. Both work.

## The point

You'll forget how you solved things. You'll want to find that article again. You'll need examples for case studies, or when you're writing a documentation for yourself later. These notes become your personal reference library.

Just start. Write something, even if it's just "today sucked, nothing worked." Better than nothing.

## Hello World

In the programming world, we start learning most things by writing a simple "Hello World" program. To get a taste of writing your first dev note, head over to [this Github Issue](https://github.com/open-making/web2025-devnotes/issues/2) to post your first message.
