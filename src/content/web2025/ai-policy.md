## What's cool and what's not 

I get it. AI tools are everywhere, and honestly, they're pretty useful for certain things. But here's the thing, this class is about you learning to think like a web designer and actually understanding what you're building, not just generating stuff. Otherwise why bother, am I right? 

So here's my take on where AI fits in this class:
## What's Totally Fine

**Code stuff**—AI is great for the technical heavy lifting. Got stuck on a CSS issue? ChatGPT can help debug that. Need help writing some JavaScript? Go for it. Want to understand how a particular tool or command works? AI can explain it patiently for the most part.

**Learning support**—Use AI to clarify concepts, research design patterns, get tool recommendations, or troubleshoot technical problems. If you're stuck on stuff like "how do responsive grids work?", it's okay with me if AI is your friend.

## What's Not Happening

**Any written work**—Essays, reflections, design rationales, project descriptions. Nope. These need to be in your voice, with your thoughts. I want to read what you think, not what GPT thinks you should think. You ain't bothering to write it, I ain't bothering to read it.

**Creative work**—Don't use AI to generate your graphics, illustrations, please. Same goes for website copy or creative writing. That may not be your preference, but please try to stick with this for the duration of the class. The whole point is for you to develop your own design voice and perspective. 

## The Deal

If you use AI for the acceptable stuff, just tell me about it. Something like: "I used ChatGPT to help debug my code and generate the initial HTML structure for my navigation." That's it. No big deal, just be transparent. You must:

- Clearly state what AI tool was used (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- Specify exactly how it was used (debugging, code generation, concept explanation)
- Include this declaration in your submission or project documentation

**Example Declaration:**

> "I used ChatGPT to help debug my CSS flexbox layout and to generate the initial HTML structure for my navigation component."

**If still uncertain, ask me before submission.** The bottom line: AI should help you learn and build, not think and create for you. There's a difference, and I trust you to know it.
