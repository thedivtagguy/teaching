## Day 3 - Seeing and Searching

Day 3 was about training our eyes to see web pages differently and getting better at solving design problems. This was also when the first mini-project got underway. The main goal was learning to break down web pages into their basic building blocks - spotting the paragraphs, headings, and images, and figuring out how styling pulls everything together. Everyone also got to play around with the browser's developer tools, tweaking values and watching pages change on the spot.

Two CSS properties got the spotlight: `display: flex` and `float: right`. Flexbox was practiced through a game called Flexbox Froggy, while we explored `float` was explored through live coding. 

Both tools give us way more control over how our layouts look and feel. Onwards to Hans Christian Andersen!
