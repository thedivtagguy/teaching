# Day 1: Down the rabbit hole

Open Class Slides
</button>

Welcome to our data visualization course! In this first session, we explored the fundamentals of data visualization, examining its historical context, core principles, and the breadth of applications in our world today.

## So what's all this then?

We started off by looking at John Snow's cholera map (I can't think of one course I've seen so far which _didn't_ start with this, so a rite of passage for you all), looked at some naturally occuring "visualizations" and then Florence Nightingale's legendary work. We also looked at the original _tables_ for the data on John Snow's map and learnt about Nightingale's disdain for such tables and her motivations for making something for the "vulgar public" (us).

After this, we looked at a variety of visualizations around us in daily life. Cricket matches, cameras, kombuchas; what have you. Its alright if your heart isn't immediately into the kind of visualizations that we might make in this course, but look at the possibilities!

There's almost something for everyone in this field, as we saw through our little diagram of overlaps. Whether you want to be a UI/UX designer, researcher, artist, or just a big ol' know it all - you can put your skills to use here and they'll never be wasted. 

I think that one of the biggest parts of getting good at this is looking at the endless amount of fascinating work by 'The Masters' and trying to understand how they make it happen and why their works resonate with us. This will form the crux of our class because we'll spend 
a lot of time not only looking at inspiration, critiquing but also trying to produce a lot of sketches, ideas, drawings, visualizations to start working both sides of our brain more. 

Each day will cover one or more of these main 'tasks' in the visualization process: 

- **Collect & Clean:** Finding and preparing data
- **Analyze & Summarize:** Understanding key patterns  
- **Visualize:** Choosing the right visual formats
- **Narrate:** Creating a story with your data
- **Design:** Making it beautiful and accessible

### Visualization Terminology[^1]

[^1]: Cairo, Alberto. ‘The Truthful Art’

<dl>
  <dt>Visualization</dt>
  <dd>A picture that informs.</dd>
  
  <dt>Chart</dt>
  <dd>A visualization in which data are encoded with symbols.</dd>
  
  <dt>Infographic</dt>
  <dd>A multi-part visual representation of information intended to communicate specific messages, combining charts, maps, illustrations, and explanatory text.</dd>
  
  <dt>Data Visualization</dt>
  <dd>A display of data designed to enable analysis, exploration, and discovery.</dd>
</dl>


<details>
  <summary>Why are the boundaries between these terms fuzzy?</summary>
  <p>In practice, these categories often overlap. A data visualization might be part of an infographic, and both use charts. The distinctions matter less than understanding the purpose of your visual and ensuring it effectively communicates the intended information.</p>
</details>
 
## Principles of Effective Visualization

What makes a visualization good? We can evaluate visualizations based on four key principles:

| Principle | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Truthful | Represents data accurately without distortion | Proper scales, appropriate baselines, proportional representations |
| Functional | Effectively serves its intended purpose | Chart type matches the data relationship being shown |
| Beautiful | Aesthetically considered | Clean design with intentional color choices |
| Insightful | Reveals patterns or relationships | Makes visible what would be hidden in tables or text |

<div class="warning">
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Data decoration is not the same as data visualization. Decorative elements should never compromise the integrity or clarity of the data being presented.</p>
</div>

## Applications of Data Visualization

We explored how visualizations appear in diverse contexts:

- **Scientific discovery** (John Snow's cholera map)
- **Photography** (histograms)
- **Sports analysis** (IPL cricket maps)
- **Fitness tracking** (running apps)
- **Climate communication** (Ed Hawkins' warming stripes)
- **Journalism** (Reuters, Financial Times, The Economist)
- **Product design** (innovative packaging)
- **Physical data representations** (LEGO city maps, light installations)
- **Entertainment** (statistical visualizations in TV/film)

### Example: Charles Minard's Napoleon's March

This famous 1869 visualization shows Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812:

- Combines six data types on a single graphic
- Shows army size, location, direction, temperature, and time
- Often cited as "the best statistical graphic ever drawn" (Edward Tufte)


## Exercises

## Poem Word Counts

We practiced visualizing a simple dataset showing the average number of words in poems written by children across different grade levels:

## Next Class Preparation

For our next session, please:
1. Find an interesting visualization (good or bad) to discuss
2. Review the resources on basic data analysis fundamentals
3. Consider what kinds of data you might be interested in visualizing for your projects
