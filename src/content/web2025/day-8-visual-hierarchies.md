# Day 8 - Visual Hierarchies

Today was about stepping back from implementation and focusing on the planning phase, which involves us transforming our content ideas into clear visual roadmaps for the work ahead.

Things we focused on:

- Moving from content gathering (yesterday's work) to visual organization. Just like we've done in previous modules with typography and layouts, we're applying systematic thinking to prioritize and structure our design decisions.
- Working with low-fidelity mockups, stripping away text, images, fonts, and colors to focus purely on layout hierarchy using simple boxes and outlines. The goal is identifying which elements deserve priority in our code and visual presentation.
