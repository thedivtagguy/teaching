## Day 8 - Visual Hierarchies

[ DETAILED SUMMARY TO BE ADDED ]

---

## Readings for today:

Please go through all the links mentioned in this blogpost: https://www.hackdesign.org/lessons/19-achieving-visual-hierarchy/

I want us to think about our sites today not as fully-designed pieces but boxes and outlines (what designers call "low-fidelity mockups"). This means taking our homepage and imaging what it would look like at its bare minimum layout, without text, without images or fonts or colors but just boxes.
