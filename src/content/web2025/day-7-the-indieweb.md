## Day 7 - The IndieWeb


What, this class isn't about flexbox or CSS grid? Have you been scammed? Well, not really.

After a full week of coding we took a break to step back and reflect on what we were doing and why in the first place; having our own creative spaces! This class was introduced as focusing on the small web and today we expanded on that through the principles and ideas of the 'indieweb'. As we saw in the slides, the indieweb is what we make of it. From now till the end of class (in two weeks), our energies will be concentrated on using our newfound analytical skills of learning how to make pages towards our own websites.

Websites need not be what we think of them traditionally as. There can be conventional spaces on our websites, but also highly personal and individual patches of personality that you can't box into one thing. The ideas of the 'digital garden' helped us visualize what this might be and we spent the afternoon brainstorming the possibilities of material we could put online and most importantly, keep tending to.

Along with the potential 'plots' for our garden, we came up with personal manifestos for what this space is to be. I recommend going through today's dev notes to see the wonderful things we have decided to dedicate our efforts to.

## The Library

I introduced our course library page today, which you can access at [/web2025/library](/web2025/library). These are readings, blogs and material that I might not share in class but have been used to prepare slides or are just generally interesting.
