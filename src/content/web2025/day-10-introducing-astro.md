# Day 10 - Introducing Astro

Today we switched gears and expanded our toolkit by stepping into the world of Astro. After a gentle intro to what Astro is, we looked at package managers: pnpm and npm, what they do, why we use them, and how they keep your projects neat and manageable.

Everyone set up a project with Astro from scratch (twice! Once by [cloning our starter](https://github.com/open-making/your-first-astro-site) and the once with the Astro tutorial) and walking through a tutorial on the Astro site about building a blockblog. Along the way, you learned the about components and also terminal basics such as installing dependencies, running development servers, and the classic “why won’t my thing run” troubleshooting.

The day’s highlight for me was that everyone got **continous deployment** working!! You push to Git and it rebuilds your site? Amazing.

The goal now is to start thinking about how this workflow (Astro + Git) can help your websites, and to keep playing with templates, custom components, and the broader framework-driven (thinking systematically, logically, structurally. Not just "ecosystem") understanding as you prepare for the work ahead.
