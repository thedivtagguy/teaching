## About This Site

This is the course site! I will be sharing all slides, content, notes, assignments and readings here. If the lecture for that day has slides, you'll find them here. Each day has its own page. 

There are two buttons on the top-left corner for links to the assignments and readings pages. If there is an assignment, all details pertaining to it (what needs to be done, when is it due, any FAQs) will be added there. Same goes for readings. 

Since we're in for a long haul, I have designed a system to help you keep track of your submissions and readings; once done you can click on "Mark as Completed" for assignments and "Mark as Read" and track your progress. **This does not actually submit or register anything with me, it is a to-do list for you and you only.** It just keeps tracks of things in your browser.
## Before you come in

This is a web-design + dev class so, you guessed it, you'll be needing your laptops every single day! No laptop, no scene. But apart from that here are some things you either need to download and keep ready or platforms you need to sign up for. **Please keep this done before Day 1**. 
### Softwares

- **VSCode**: Download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). This will be our integrated development environment (IDE) of choice, it is where we will write our code.
- **Git**: Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This is what is called a 'version control' system, it helps us in saving our progress as we work on things. More on this later, take my word for it now. There are different ways to install it. If you are on Mac, refer to [this guide here]. Windows folks have a straight-forward installer. 
### Platforms

- [Github](https://github.com): This is how we will be submitting our exercises and putting our projects live on the web. More on this later, but for the moment please sign up and create an account. 
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com): This is what takes our code and puts it on a URL anyone, anywhere can access. For free! Create an account here please. 
- [Figma](https://figma.com): Designs, presentations, mockups, wireframes and more. Sign up!

Non-essential, but if you've signed up for a Github account, you're eligible for a _ton_ of free goodies because you're a student. Make use of them! Applying for the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack#offers)gives you access to a lot of stuff, including a free domain name for one year, Notion Pro and a bunch of other stuff. It's good stuff, get some!
