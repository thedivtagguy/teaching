# What is this class and why?

This post explains the rationale for the class. It will help you understand my rationale for why I have designed the class the way that I have, and what you should expect from it and me.

To start with, I love the web. I started making websites in 7th grade, at that time I used something called Weebly to make sites on whatever it was that I cared about at the time; Harry Potter, BBC Sherlock, and other things of little importance. While those sites are pretty silly in retrospect, what that did teach me, what I've been learning and loving ever since, is how incredible it is to own a little corner of the web. Making websites is fun, challenging and in a little way, empowering. I went from drag-and-drop sites, to Wordpress to learning HTML/CSS/JS and making websites from scratch. That is now my job. 

But in 2025, the landscape is very different. Most of you would have used ChatGPT at least once, and/or other tools like Lovable, Bolt and numerous other thingamajigs that just "generate" code and "websites" for you. Learning how to make for the web is not what it was, and while it is true that fundamentals need to be learnt, some of the hoops that people had to jump through are no longer required. So what does it mean to learn web design in an age where a cat walking across a keyboard might accidentally "prompt" a website on ChatGPT? What, you might ask, is the point?

In this course, I'd like to be able to do a couple of things for you: 

**Firstly, leave you with some tangible skills at the end of this course.** Regardless of your current level of comfort with design and code, I'd like for you to be able to make websites of your own whenever you want to, know enough to not let some developer get the better of you in the future, and have hard skills in form of HTML/CSS and web frameworks. AI or not, some skills will always be required. Don't worry about where you are now, I will get you to this point. 

**Secondly, you should have an understanding of how to make for the web**; whether you approach it from a systems, design or code perspective. Just as there is a way to think about print design that's different from thinking about sculpture or painting, there's a particular way to think about web design that's different from other mediums. The web is interactive, responsive, accessible, and inherently collaborative. Understanding these constraints and possibilities will make you a better designer, regardless of what tools you use.

**But more importantly, I want try and make you fall in love with the idea of making websites.** We live in an era where most of our digital presence is mediated by platforms—Instagram, LinkedIn, Behance, Twitter. These platforms can disappear, change their rules, or decide they don't want your content anymore. A personal website is different. It's yours. There's a growing movement of designers, writers, coders, and creators who are reclaiming that space. They're building personal websites that are weird, wonderful, and deeply personal. They're treating their websites as creative practice, not just professional necessity, and in an age where internet is cluttered with AI garbage, these spaces set us apart. This is what I want for you. Our final project will be a personal portfolio that you will make for yourself from scratch, using everything you've learnt.

## What This Class Is (and Isn't)

We're not going to be learning to code for the sake of coding. While you'll learn HTML, CSS, and work with things like, as you'll learn, static site generators, the code is always in service of design and creative expression. If you're already comfortable with code, great—you'll have more time to focus on the design and content strategy aspects. If you've never written a line of code, that's fine too. We'll start from the beginning and build up together. 

I believe the best way to learn web design is to actually build something you care about. That's why almost every class session combines design thinking with hands-on implementation. You'll be working on your own site from day one, making real decisions about stuff that matters to you, and how it ties with our broader discussions and exercises on systems, thinking and strategies.

Welcome aboard!

I'm excited to see what we'll build.

This could be us by the end of this class:

## House Rules

- **Attendance is mandatory**. The time we have is barely enough, and each day adds something that will help drive your final projects. Missing any day will leave you at a disadvantage. Please try to make it every day. If you cannot, please inform me a day before. 
- **AI Policy**: Please go through this [AI Policy Document]. All submitted **written** work must be your own. If you’re using any sort of LLM for Q/A about a _technical_ part of the process and not the written output itself, that is acceptable as long as it is **clearly declared to what extent an LLM was used**. Again, go through the document.
- Have fun. Plis.
