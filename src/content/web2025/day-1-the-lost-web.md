## The Lost Web

Today, we explored the "why" behind this class. 

We began by asking what it means to be a creative in the age of AI. The traditional, siloed model of web creation—where designers create static blueprints and "hand them off" to developers—is becoming less relevant. Instead, there's immense value in being a **"T-shaped" creator**: someone with deep expertise in one area (like design) but with a broad enough understanding of adjacent fields (like code) to build, experiment, and communicate effectively.

### The Small Web vs. The Corporate Web

To understand our purpose, we went on a brief **Internet Archaeology** expedition. We looked back at the early, "vernacular" web of the 1990s, particularly platforms like **GeoCities**. This era was characterized by personal, expressive, and delightfully chaotic websites made by ordinary people. It was a digital space where individuals could build their own corners of the web.

This stands in stark contrast to today's web, which is dominated by a few massive, centralized platforms. The corporate web often convinces us that making a website is too hard, trapping us in limited, template-driven systems.

This course is a call to rediscover the **"Small Web"**: a space for websites that are personal, artisanal, and "author-centric." It's a space where you don't have to optimize for engagement or follow rigid conventions. It's your garden, not a factory.
