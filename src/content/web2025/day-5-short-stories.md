## Reflections on Week 1

As I said yesterday, I have consistently underestimated the ambitions of this class. It has been a pleasure to see you all finding a way to bring your designs to life, even if during some times during the process we felt annoyed with the browser not obeying us. I hope that the fact that it was toiling for our own visions made the end result rewarding. We didn't make _dabbas_, at least (and as HAC says above, maybe that is our misfortune).

Surprising as it may be, there sometimes is no _hack_ to get things working just right. I have lost many hours locating where the correct margin or the padding might be, what on earth is the parent to my absolutely positioned `img` and why won't it just _GET WHERE IT SHOULD BE._ It is a part of the process. The process looks stupid sometimes.

Here is how many people [search how to center a div](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=how%20to%20center%20a%20div&hl=en) on Google.

You are now a part of this rich culture.

Through this exercise, we seem to have walked away with the knowledge of many, many more CSS properties than we had previously bargained for and even though all of them might be a little foggy at this stage, that is alright. No one needs to remember all of them, what we did figure out much more importantly was **searching for answers and debugging our errors**.

What I also really appreciate is you helping each other with what you figured out and taking up the task of debugging someone else's errors. There is no gatekeeping in this class, love that.

A great week, in my opinion.

## An Anthology

<div class="flex justify-between items-start md:flex-row flex-col">


I have compiled all your great work into a single webpage, so we can go through each other's work. You can also send this to people and tell them _"HEY, I MADE THAT"_.


<Button size="lg" target="_blank" variant="purple" class="!text-white mb-4 py-6" href="https://teaching.aman.bh/web2025/short-stories"> Short Stories »</Button>
</div>

Next week, we begin to think about what our own personal corners of the internet will look like. This will end in us having a personal website of our own, at the end of the next two weeks.

More tools, more annoyances, more learnings but all guided by our personal visions of how to use these things.

Have a great weekend!
