We're going to put today's learning into practice with two projects. One will be deliberately terrible, the other will be your own creative vision.

### Part 1: Make Something Ugly (In Class Activity)

We did this together in class, but if you missed it or want to iterate: take the [Hey Jude starter repository](https://github.com/open-making/web2025-hey-jude), clone it locally, and make it as visually offensive as possible. Use clashing colors, weird fonts, broken layouts; anything goes. The goal is to learn CSS properties through experimentation rather than trying to follow design rules.

Once you're satisfied with your monstrosity:

1. Push it to GitHub using the Git workflow we learned
2. Deploy it to Netlify
3. Share the live URL because we want to see your beautiful disaster

### Part 2: Structure Something You Care About

Choose a piece of content that matters to you—any text that you want to give proper structure and presentation. This could be:

- Lyrics from a song you love
- An article or essay you find compelling
- A short story or piece of creative writing
- An interview with someone interesting
- Poetry or spoken word pieces

**Your task:**

1. **Structure it with HTML**: Think about hierarchy—what are the main sections? What needs to be emphasized? How would you break this content into logical pieces using headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements?
    
2. **Style it with CSS**: This doesn't have to be fancy, but it should feel purposeful. Consider font sizing, spacing, color, and layout. How does the visual presentation support the content?
    
3. **Deploy it**: Use the same Git + GitHub + Netlify workflow to put it online.
    

You'll need to research CSS properties we didn't cover in class. Ask questions like "How do I change the font?" or "How do I add spacing between paragraphs?" and Google them. This is normal and to be honest, one of the most important skills you should develop. Web development 50% coding, 50% looking up things and knowing how to find answers.
