We're going to put today's learning into practice with two projects. One will be deliberately terrible, the other will be your own creative vision.

### Make Something Ugly

We did this together in class, but if you missed it or want to iterate: take the [Hey Jude starter repository](https://github.com/open-making/web2025-hey-jude), clone it locally, and make it as visually offensive as possible. Use clashing colors, weird fonts, broken layouts; anything goes. The goal is to learn CSS properties through experimentation rather than trying to follow design rules.

Once you're satisfied with your monstrosity:

1. Push it to GitHub using the Git workflow we learned
2. Deploy it to Netlify
3. Share the live URL because we want to see your beautiful disaster

You'll need to research CSS properties we didn't cover in class. Ask questions like "How do I change the font?" or "How do I add spacing between paragraphs?" and Google them. This is normal and to be honest, one of the most important skills you should develop. Web development 50% coding, 50% looking up things and knowing how to find answers.
