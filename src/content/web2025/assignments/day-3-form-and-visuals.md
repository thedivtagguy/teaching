### Part 2: Structure Something You Care About

Choose a piece of content that matters to you—any text that you want to give proper structure and presentation. This could be:

- Lyrics from a song you love
- An article or essay you find compelling
- A short story or piece of creative writing
- An interview with someone interesting
- Poetry or spoken word pieces

Once you have chosen your piece of text:

1. **Structure it with HTML**: Think about hierarchy—what are the main sections? What needs to be emphasized? How would you break this content into logical pieces using headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements?
    
2. **Style it with CSS**: This doesn't have to be fancy, but it should feel purposeful. Consider font sizing, spacing, color, and layout. How does the visual presentation support the content?
    
3. **Deploy it**: Use the same Git + GitHub + Netlify workflow to put it online.
