### Hans Christian Andersen's Short Stories

On Day 3, we each chose a story from a book by HAC. We made some great designs and then attempted to bring them to the web using the languages we learnt all of this week.

Once you have chosen your piece of text:

1. **Structure it with HTML**: Think about hierarchyâ€”what are the main sections? What needs to be emphasized? How would you break this content into logical pieces using headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements?

2. **Style it with CSS**: This doesn't have to be fancy, but it should feel purposeful. Consider font sizing, spacing, color, and layout. How does the visual presentation support the content?

3. **Deploy it**: Use the earlier learnt Netlify workflow to put it online and give it a nice URL (rename it to something nice).


When you're done with the above, head to the submission form by clicking on the 'Submit' button on the sidebar. It will take you to a form which looks like this:

![](/assets/assignments/IMG-20250725092219021.png)

Here, all you have to do is enter:
- The name of the story you chose
- Your name
- The URL for your story.

Having done that, click 'Create' to submit. We will compile all our websites into another website for us to view all stories together in one place.
