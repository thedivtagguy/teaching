# CSS Grids

Take a look at the following grid designs. Each design is something that you'd probably find yourself wanting to use when you decide to lay out your website. Grid lines have also been drawn to help you see the grid in practice.

Solve at least two of these designs. Using the process of writing markup and incrementally styling it in a separate CSS file, bring these to life. I also encourage you to place your own content and give it your own styles (text, colors, fonts, images). I am more interested in you figuring out how to lay these out rather than copying the design 1:1.

Once you are done, push your designs to Netlify (you can put everything in the same page **or learn how to create two separate pages and link them**) and submit the link.
