# The first websites


---


Personal websites soon comprised most of the public sites on the early Internet and essentially became the public face of the Internet.

Other than a few blank placeholder websites, corporations and governments had not even established their presences on the Internet. Most were not even convinced that they should be there.

notes: Back in the early 1990's, the spirit of the Internet was the pursuit of knowledge, exploration, innovation, fun, and community. Immediately after going public, it began to swell with websites created by tech nerds who enjoyed playing and experimenting with the new technology. Individuals created their own websites mostly for fun and for the learning experiences that they afforded. Most discussed little more than computer gaming, technical interests, and geeky hobbies.
