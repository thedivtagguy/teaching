# What Is This Class? 

Before we answer that, I would like to situate my context for you. 

---

## Who here thinks AI is a good thing? 

---

## Who here thinks AI is a bad thing? 


---

## I ask this because things...have changed

I promise you I am not an AI salesman/LinkedIn Lunatic; but they certainly have.

---

When you think of making websites, you might have been taught about this general process.

## This model is not invalid. It’s still how many websites are built.

### And for many projects, this works great. <!--element class='fragment'-->


---

The problem with it is that as designers, we're often told to care about "our side" of the process. 

- Conduct user research.
- Create low-fidelity wireframes.
- Develop high-fidelity wireframes.
- Establish visual identities.
- Oversee developer implementation.
- "Stay in your lane."

---

### But what if you want more?

- Understand what's possible before you design
- Communicate better with developers
- Making your own weird experimental thing

---

### Staying in your lane is alright

But sometimes you might want to cross the street.


---

<split even>

<div>

### This isn't about asking you to become everything

No one needs to do everything! But being a little T-shaped is a huge advantage.

<div>

Because when computers can talk and write code for us, make entire products from scratch, where does that leave us? What are the lanes?

- Do we need designers who just design?<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Do we need coders who just code?<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Do we need mockups and wireframes, or is all just vibes?<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Does everyone become a manager?<!--element class='fragment'-->

Are there any lanes? <!--element class='fragment'-->

</div>

## I don't know, it is too early to tell

But to me, one thing is clear; there is no disadvantage in: 

- Learning a little more and developing familiarity with all parts of the process.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Being able to prototype and iterate quickly without depending on others.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Having direct conversations with the medium you're designing for.<!--element class='fragment'-->

I think LLM's make this easier than ever before. .<!--element class='fragment'-->

## Is AI good? Is AI bad?
Like with a lot of things, the most sensible answer is...it depends.


Me, I think of it and it's usefulness in the context of code.

<split even>

## My View

I resonate with this [blogpost](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/is-it-okay/) by Robin Sloan on whether AI is "okay".

## So should designers code? 


Maybe that is the wrong question...<!--element class='fragment'-->

> A design is never “ready for dev”, because a lot of what we consider to be design decisions – interaction, animation, loading of data – can really only be prototyped in code. “Ready for dev” implies that the creation is done and that the developer is merely there to execute the designer’s vision

## That is the point of this class

We want to focus on learning a bit on **how to make The Thing for our purposes**, not become expert developers who are writing code for production-ready software. 
<br/>
Code is the means to an end.

#### Because AI doesn't mean you "don't need to learn anything". 
<split even gap="2">

<div>

Understanding what code is, how to get what you want, and how to be in control is just as necessary.


<br/>
 For that we need to get our fundamentals in order.

### The Just-Enough Rule

<div>

The amount you _could_ learn is endless and overwhelming.

The amount you _can_ learn just enough to get started is manageable and more meaningful.

- hands-on
- experimental
- ambitious

Personal websites soon comprised most of the public sites on the early Internet and essentially became the public face of the Internet.

Other than a few blank placeholder websites, corporations and governments had not even established their presences on the Internet. 


**Most were not even convinced that they should be there.**

</div>

notes: Back in the early 1990's, the spirit of the Internet was the pursuit of knowledge, exploration, innovation, fun, and community. Immediately after going public, it began to swell with websites created by tech nerds who enjoyed playing and experimenting with the new technology. Individuals created their own websites mostly for fun and for the learning experiences that they afforded. Most discussed little more than computer gaming, technical interests, and geeky hobbies.

## Enter the era of Geocities

Geocities was divided into "neighborhoods", like area and street names, where users could "claim" their web site. The neighborhoods where intended to cover different topics, [here is an incomplete list](http://www.bladesplace.id.au/geocities-neighborhoods-suburbs.html).
