## Does the web have to be this way?

Depends on what you think of the web as.

## The web is a city

notes: I believe that the principles behind good urban form and community are very similar to the principles of an ideal internet; and that the modern american city shares many similar qualities and shortcomings as does the structure of the internet, simply through a different spatial medium.

## The web is many things

But when we think about "web design"...

---

...you might have been taught a process that looks something like this.

![](IMG-20250720232116728.png)


<div class="compact-cite">

<div class="publisher">
  
</div>
</div>


---

This is the traditional waterfall model: a linear, sequential process where each stage is completed before the next one begins.

---

## This model is not invalid. It’s still how many websites are built.

### And for many projects, this works great. <!--element class='fragment'-->


---

The problem with it is that as designers, we're often told to care about "our side" of the process. This model almost encourages us to be siloed. 

- Conduct user research.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Create low-fidelity wireframes.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Develop high-fidelity wireframes.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Establish visual identities.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Oversee developer implementation.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- "Stay in your lane."<!--element class='fragment'-->

 It positions the designer as someone who creates a static blueprint, which is then handed over to a developer to be "executed."<!--element class='fragment'-->
 
notes: This "stay in your lane" mentality creates a gap. A gap in understanding, a gap in communication, and most importantly, a gap in creative potential. 

---

Also, I can't say this enough, it makes it **boring**. 

---

<split even gap="1">

<div>

Because when computers can talk and write code for us, make entire products from scratch, where does that leave us? **What are the lanes?**

- Do we need designers who just design?<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Do we need coders who just code?<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Do we need mockups and wireframes, or is all just vibes?<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Does everyone become a manager?<!--element class='fragment'-->

**Are there any lanes?** <!--element class='fragment'-->

</div>

![](IMG-20250720232116755.png)



</split>


---

## I don't know, it is too early to tell

But to me, one thing is clear; there is no disadvantage in: 

- Learning a little more about all parts of the process.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Being able to prototype and iterate quickly without depending on others.<!--element class='fragment'-->
- Having direct conversations with the medium you're designing for.<!--element class='fragment'-->

I think LLM's make this easier than ever before, especially for people who might be "afraid" of code.<!--element class='fragment'-->

---

This brings us to the perennial, and frankly, boring question.
## So should designers code? 


Maybe that is the wrong question...<!--element class='fragment'-->

notes: It frames coding as a simple vocational skill to be acquired, like learning to use a new piece of software. The real question is about the nature of the medium itself and our relationship to it.

notes: The point is that code isn't just an implementation detail; it's the _material_ of the web. It's the clay. You can't truly understand what's possible with clay, its texture, its weight, its limitations, and its surprising possibilities, until you get your hands dirty. You need to have that direct conversation with the medium.

### This isn't about asking you to become "coders"

No one needs to do everything! But being a little T-shaped is a huge advantage. 
</div>

![IMG|500](IMG-20250720232116801.png)


</split>

notes: You have your expertise in your core discipline, that's the vertical bar of the T. But you also cultivate a broad-enough understanding of adjacent fields, the horizontal bar, to collaborate effectively, to prototype your own ideas, and to have a direct, hands-on conversation with the materials you're working with.

---

## That is the point of this class

We want to focus on learning **how to make "The Thing" for our purposes**, not become expert developers.
<br/>
Code is the means to an end. 

notes: We're learning to code not to become professional developers, but to become better designers, thinkers, and makers. We're learning just enough to be creatively independent, to build our own prototypes, and to express our own ideas directly in the native language of the web.


---

## It will be the web, on our own terms

Hand-made, professional, playful, weird, personal, rough-edged, polished; no option is more valid than the other.


---

## How do we do this? 



---


### The Just-Enough Rule


The amount **you _could_ learn** is endless and overwhelming. 

The amount **you _can_ learn just enough** to get started is manageable and more meaningful.



---

### I'm not looking for the "perfect" outputs.

---

Instead I would like you to think:
## What do you care about? 

Because you said it yourself...

# The first websites

---

The first website _ever_ was just a bunch of text and links, created in 1992.

![](IMG-20250720232117252.png)

notes: This period was defined by technical limitations rather than aesthetic choices, with websites serving purely functional purposes for information sharing among researchers.


---

### But the real explosion was to happen in the mid-90s

Personal websites soon comprised most of the public sites on the early Internet and essentially became the public face of the Internet.

Other than a few blank placeholder websites, corporations and governments had not even established their presences on the Internet. 


**Most were not even convinced that they should be there.**

</div>
</div>

notes: Back in the early 1990's, the spirit of the Internet was the pursuit of knowledge, exploration, innovation, fun, and community. Immediately after going public, it began to swell with websites created by tech nerds who enjoyed playing and experimenting with the new technology. Individuals created their own websites mostly for fun and for the learning experiences that they afforded. Most discussed little more than computer gaming, technical interests, and geeky hobbies.

## Enter the era of Geocities

---

<split even gap="1">

Geocities was divided into "neighborhoods", like area and street names, where users could "claim" their web site. 



The neighborhoods where intended to cover different topics, but you could also just host your own website there.

 Geocities was important because it provided **a system for creative expression that worked for everyone**: coding space for those with HTML skills and simple navigation tools for beginners to build pages

<br/>
It was not the only place where people did this, but it was by far the most popular.

## The Vernacular of the Old, Personal Web

Animated GIFs, page hit counters, scrolling marquee text, "under construction" signs, and wild tiled backgrounds. It's easy to look back now from our minimalist, professionally designed present and call it "bad design."...

### The Flash Renaissance

Flash enabled designers to break free from HTML limitations, creating experiences that resembled multimedia art installations more than traditional websites

</span>

 note: Designers could control every pixel, create custom typography, and integrate multimedia elements seamlessly. This led to websites that functioned as digital brand experiences, with elaborate visual narratives and sophisticated interaction design

### Shifting to Mobile

The early 2010s brought an aesthetic shift because we started having smaller screens. It was all about making for the efficiency now. 

---

![](IMG-20250720232117705.png)

note: Skeuomorphic web design incorporated realistic textures, drop shadows, beveled edges, and metaphorical elements that referenced physical objects. Buttons looked like physical buttons with depth and shadow. File systems used folder icons that resembled real manila folders. Trash cans looked like actual waste baskets


---

![](IMG-20250720232117741.png)

note: Flat design philosophy prioritize efficiency and cross-platform consistency The aesthetic featured bright, saturated colors, simple geometric shapes, minimal use of shadows or gradients, and generous white space

## The Platform Web

The new corporate web is built on convincing you that making a website is hard, complicated.


---
### A business model built on telling you that you can't

notes: Website builders lure you in with "free" tiers that are intentionally and severely limited. They hold your content, your design, and your audience hostage, preventing you from using your own domain name and constantly upselling you to the next subscription tier. Their goal is to make you a perpetual renter, not an owner.

## Not always user-centric

<split even gap="1">

<span class="fragment">

Yes! **The Small Web can be "author-centric".** It can be you-centric. It’s the difference between product and art.


</span>


</split>

notes:  One is not better than the other. They serve different needs and both can co-exist in an open web. It would nevertheless be a shame if we only spent time on the commercial web and never got the opportunity to experience the creativity, passion and quirkiness of the small web.

## Before looking forward, let us look back

To really grasp what's special about making your own things on the web today, we may benefit from doing a dive into a bit of history.

---

We're going on an expedition, a bit of **Internet Archaeology**, to dig through the digital histories of the late 90s and early 2000s.


---

### The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine

[The most important tool](https://web.archive.org/) for any internet archaeologist. It has saved snapshots of billions of web pages over time.

---

<split even gap="2">

Enter a URL, select a year from the timeline, then click on a specific date in the calendar to see a snapshot of the site from that day.

![IMG|700](IMG-20250720232118105.png)

</split>


notes: The goal is to move beyond simple aesthetic judgment ("this looks ugly") and toward historical analysis ("_why_ does it look this way?")

### The GeoCities Archives

Since GeoCities was shut down by Yahoo in 2009, volunteer groups like the Archive Team have rescued and archived terabytes of its data. 

---

<split even gap="2">

- https://geocities.restorativland.org/ Direct mirrors of old GeoCities sites, neatly sorted by their original "neighborhood". A bit like wandering through the ruins themselves.
- [One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age](https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/): An art project by Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied that posts random, automated screenshots from the archive.

### The Web Design Museum

<split even gap="2">

<div>

[A gallery of screenshots and videos of websites through the years.](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/all-websites)

Almost the same as the Internet Archive, but organized in a browsable way.

## Activity Brief

1. Dive into each of these archives. Get lost. Follow links. See what you can find. Maybe look for a website you're interested in if you're using the Internet Archive.
    
2. Find and document at least **7 different types of "artifacts"** that you find interesting. Weird buttons, unconventional menus, graphics, illustrations, these can be anything.
    
3. For each artifact, ask: What does this tell me about the person who made it? What does it say about the technology of the time? Why don't we see this anymore? What need did it serve?

## What did you find in the ruins?


---

Your main takeaway for today should be
## There is no one right way to design or make.

<split even gap="2">

We'll start some making tomorrow!!
