## Day 3 â€” Git and Version Control

Today we dove deep into Git and version control - the backbone of modern software development. We learned how to track changes, collaborate with others, and deploy our work professionally.

**Here's what we covered**

- Version control concepts: Understanding why we need systems to track changes to our code over time, and how Git solves collaboration challenges.

- Terminal basics: Learning to use the command line interface to navigate our computer and run Git commands efficiently.

- Essential Git commands: We mastered `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` - the core workflow for saving and sharing our work.

- GitHub integration: How to connect our local repositories to GitHub and push our code to the cloud for backup and sharing.

- Professional workflows: Setting up continuous deployment with Netlify so our websites update automatically when we push new code.

- Git best practices: Writing meaningful commit messages and understanding the typical development workflow.
