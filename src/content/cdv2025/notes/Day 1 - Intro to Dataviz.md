# Intro to Dataviz


Facilitator: Aman Bhargava

## We start in London, 1850

Try to imagine yourself walking its streets in the mid-19th century.

---

Between 1848 to 1854, cholera was one of the most feared diseases in the city.

Most people blamed "miasmas" - invisible poisonous particles from decomposing matter or bad smells. This theory seemed plausible since disease-ridden slums often did smell terrible.

### Enter John Snow.

He suspected something there was something fundamentally different about cholera that couldn't be explained away by bad air. <!-- element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

To test his theory during the second outbreak, Snow started investigating deaths in the neighbourhood. He went about this in a very methodical way, wanting to relate three distinct things: 

- Proximity to water sources
- Occurence of diseases
- The _density_ of this occurence

The map confirmed what Snow's hypothesis and findings - deaths clustered around the Broad Street water pump. The closer people lived to this pump, the more likely they were to die.

It is important to remember that John Snow didn't just happen to plot this on a map and come to a realization about the pump's importance. 
It was the **powerful visual evidence of a theory**, and subsequent analysis. 


The visualization transformed the **ideas and numbers into something that could demand action**.

Would this have been as persuasive without a visual? 

Perhaps, but perhaps not.

## What is this class and why? 

Data visualization is one of the best intersections of the various facets of design that you often encounter in isolation. 

Design, psychology, storytelling, graphics, art

and of course, 'youeyeyouex'. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

---

![[IMG-20250318122419246.png|600]]


---
And regardless of what you might think,

![[IMG-20250318010106097.png|400]]



---

But first, we need to rewire our brains a little.

We'll focus on understanding fundamental principles, developing critical ways of seeing, learning to ask the right questions of our data for answers, and finally, turning those into beautiful graphics.

We'll read a lot, refer to the works of a diverse group of people, critique, redesign, and make. 

We want to be able to think in terms of data visualization. <!-- element class="fragment" -->

Implementation comes later. Ideas come first. <!-- element class="fragment" -->


---

But for that we need to chase some balloons.

![[IMG-20250318004659043.png|500]]

---
So let's take a step back

### **What is a 'visualization'?** 

---

Well, at the minimum it is something that is:

- Based on some _non-visual data_. 
- Something graphic.

---

But to what end?

---

Here's one way of thinking about it:



> Visualizations are **pictures** that help **people** **do things**. <br/>
> Good ones make it **easy to see what's needed**.

It can be many, many things, because some form of visualization is everywhere.

...or battery life...

---

 ...sometimes, visualizations become important _verbs_ in themselves, turning into a powerful communication tool...

Anyway, so:

<center>

> Visualizations are **pictures** that help **people** **do things**. 
</center>

Those things can be <!--element class="fragment"-->
<span class="fragment">serious,</span> <span class="fragment">fun,</span> <span class="fragment">educational,</span> <span class="fragment">informative,</span> <span class="fragment">elegant,</span> <span class="fragment">emotive,</span> <span class="fragment">or just simply interesting</span>.

---


If we go with the idea that the purpose of a visualization is to help someone do something, then it is equally important to ask **what are you trying to help them do and how will you do it?**

> The purpose of infographics and data visualizations is to enlighten people‚Äînot to entertain them, not to sell them products, services, or ideas, but to inform them. It‚Äôs as simple‚Äîand as complicated‚Äîas that.
> ~ Alberto Cairo, The Truthful Art

---

- **Visualization**: A picture that informs.
- **Chart**: A visualization in which data are encoded with symbols.
- **Infographic**: An infographic is a _multi-part_ visual representation of information intended to communicate one or more specific messages. Infographics are made of a mix of charts, maps, illustrations, and text that provides explanation and context.
- **Data visualization**: A data visualization is a display of data designed to enable analysis, exploration, and discovery.


But the boundaries are \*waves hand\* fuzzy.
