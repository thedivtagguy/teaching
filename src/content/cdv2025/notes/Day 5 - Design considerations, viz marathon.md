is complete not when nothing more can be added, but when nothing more can be taken away from it.
As I see it, you want to meet two criteria: first, your graphic must be sufficiently _eye-catching_ to a non-expert who just happens to glance at it, and sufficiently _interesting_ to hold their attention and leave them feeling confident to tell others what they learned from it. But second, it must satisfy those who already have expert knowledge of the topic, depriving them of any reason to complain about things being ‘dumbed down’.
