  {"id":"cairoGraphicsLiesMisleading2015","abstract":"The past two decades have witnessed an increased awareness of the power of information visualization to bring attention to relevant issues and to inform audiences. However, the mirror image of that awareness, the study of how graphs, charts, maps, and diagrams can be used to deceive, has remained within the boundaries of academic circles in statistics, cartography, and computer science. Visual journalists and information graphics designers—who we will call evidencedriven visual communicators—have been mostly absent of this debate. This has led to disastrous results in many cases, as those professions are—even in an era of shrinking news media companies—the main intermediaries between the complexity of the world and citizens of democratic nations.

  {"id":"dwyerScalableVersatileSimple2009","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              We describe a new technique for graph layout subject to constraints. Compared to previous techniques the proposed method is much faster and scalable to much larger graphs. For a graph with\n              n\n              nodes,\n              m\n              edges and\n              c\n              constraints it computes incremental layout in time\n              O\n              (\n              n\n              log\n              n\n              +\n              m\n              +\n              c\n              ) per iteration. Also, it supports a much more powerful class of constraint: inequalities or equalities over the Euclidean distance between nodes. We demonstrate the power of this technique by application to a number of diagramming conventions which previous constrained graph layout methods could not support. Further, the constraint‐satisfaction method—inspired by recent work in position‐based dynamics—is far simpler to implement than previous methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dwyer","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"dwyerScalableVersatileSimple2009","container-title":"Computer Graphics Forum","container-title-short":"Computer Graphics Forum","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01449.x","ISSN":"0167-7055, 1467-8659","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6]]},"language":"en","page":"991-998","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scalable, Versatile and Simple Constrained Graph Layout","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01449.x","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"gibsonSurveyTwodimensionalGraph2013","abstract":"Many algorithms for graph layout have been devised over the last 30 years spanning both the graph drawing and information visualisation communities. This article first reviews the advances made in the field of graph drawing that have then often been applied by the information visualisation community. There then follows a discussion of a range of techniques developed specifically for graph visualisations. Graph drawing algorithms are categorised into the following approaches: force-directed layouts, the use of dimension reduction in graph layout and computational improvements including multi-level techniques. Methods developed specifically for graph visualisation often make use of node-attributes and are categorised based on whether the attributes are used to introduce constraints to the layout, provide a clustered view or define an explicit representation in two-dimensional space. The similarities and distinctions between these techniques are examined and the aim is to provide a detailed assessment of currently available graph layout techniques, specifically how they can be used by visualisation practitioners, and to motivate further research in the area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Faith","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Vickers","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"gibsonSurveyTwodimensionalGraph2013","container-title":"Information Visualization","container-title-short":"Information Visualization","DOI":"10.1177/1473871612455749","ISSN":"1473-8716, 1473-8724","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","page":"324-357","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A survey of two-dimensional graph layout techniques for information visualisation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1473871612455749","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"vonlandesbergerVisualAnalysisLarge2011","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The analysis of large graphs plays a prominent role in various fields of research and is relevant in many important application areas. Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques cover techniques that had been introduced until 2000 or concentrate only on graph layouts published until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as time‐varying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graph‐structured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this State‐of‐the‐Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review first considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process. We also present main open research challenges in this field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Von Landesberger","given":"T."},{"family":"Kuijper","given":"A."},{"family":"Schreck","given":"T."},{"family":"Kohlhammer","given":"J."},{"family":"Van Wijk","given":"J.J."},{"family":"Fekete","given":"J.‐D."},{"family":"Fellner","given":"D.W."}],"citation-key":"vonlandesbergerVisualAnalysisLarge2011","container-title":"Computer Graphics Forum","container-title-short":"Computer Graphics Forum","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x","ISSN":"0167-7055, 1467-8659","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1719-1749","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visual Analysis of Large Graphs: State‐of‐the‐Art and Future Research Challenges","title-short":"Visual Analysis of Large Graphs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x","volume":"30"},
