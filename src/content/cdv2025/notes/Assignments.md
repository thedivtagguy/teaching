## Day 1: Down the Rabbit Hole

### Assignment 1: Longlist and Prosper

Welcome to 'Intro to Dataviz'! We've just had a whirlwind and _extremely quick_ tour some landmark visualizations and some whos/whats/whys of this field. This is just a tip of the iceberg, though, so today's assignment is meant to be a little exploratory. 

- Go through the works at this year's [Information is Beautiful Awards longlist](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?award=2024&pcategory=long-list&type=awards) and do some browsing of things at Flowing Data (search for a keyword, roam around, click on random tags, roll a dice; do something serendipitious). Pick at least 5 different projects (or a visualization within a project if it has many) that capture your interest.
- For each visualization, make a list of 2-3 questions that the visualization can answer. Think of questions that make this visualization more useful than a table. "Useful" is a loaded word and it can mean many things; efficiency, productivity, clarity, brevity, insightfulness and so on. But we don't _have_ to think in those terms all the time, nor do we have to force ourselves to like something that we don't, if we prefer the earlier things. So figure out what makes a visualization useful and appealing _to you_. Think about it!
- For at least two visualizations, list 3 positive critiques and 3 negative critiques.

**Due:** 24th 10pm
## Assignment 2

As you go through projects in the IIBA longlist, and maybe other newsrooms if you'd like, I'd like you to think about data about yourself, or data about things around you that you can collect. Number of spoons vs forks in the cafeteria? Locations of trees on campus? Shows you've watched this year? It can be anything. Think of what is worth recording for you. For example, if I am interested in making a note of my runs in the past few months, I'd want to record:

- Date of run
- Time of run (evening, morning, afternoon)
- Where I ran
- How much I ran
- How long it took me

These become my _variables_ and in the next class, we'll learn more about them (and what we can do with them). But in order to do that, we want to have some data!

In a Google Sheet (no Excel, please), start recording your data. Don't worry about the format, or if there's a right or wrong way.

**Due**: 25th 10pm

## Day 2: Visual Encodings


Today we got all experimental and looked at analyzing our data from yesterday's survey in the likeness of Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's beautiful project, Dear Data. 

We all almost done all of it in class, but some folks haven't yet finished everything so today's submission is putting your finishing touches to the postcards (and writing nice legends!) and closing this activity. 

We also had a lovely discussion and critique session today. We want to incorporate some of those comments into the submission as well. When people engaged with your dataviz, how did they react? What did they say, what did you have to explain to them? After you listened to all comments, what are your own realizations? The good, the bad, the ugly? Please write a short reflection (no more than 300 words) on receiving this critique, and if you made any changes, document that too. 

## Submission

The PDF should include: 
- Your submission's pictures. Clear photographs of the data viz and the legend. 
- Reflection after critiques. 
- If you had any iterations in the process of coming up with these pieces (things you drew but later abandoned, for example), add those too!



We've been exploring visualization best practices and principles, but now it's time to get more _experimental_! Today we're diving into the intersection of data, art, and visual encoding.

- Take some time to explore Erica Gunn's fascinating blog posts about data visualization as artistic practice. Then check out related work from other data artists like Giorgia Lupi, Stefanie Posavec, and Nadieh Bremer. Notice how they translate data into visual elements!
- Find or collect 1-3 small datasets that actually interest you (seriously, don't pick something boring just because you think it's "proper"). These can be tiny - even just 5-15 data points is fine! Look through our data dumps, find something online, or better yet, collect something yourself. Number of times your roommate says "literally" in a day? Colors of cars in the campus parking lot? Whatever captures your curiosity.
- For each dataset, develop your own "encoding systems" - essentially, rules for how your data maps to visual variables. Be specific about these rules! For example: "Circle size represents hours spent on Instagram; color intensity shows how guilty I felt about it."
- Now the fun part: using pen, paper, and any analog materials you want (but **no digital tools!**), create at least 10 small square compositions following your encoding systems. Play with different arrangements - grids, clusters, whatever feels right. Try different mark types - dots, lines, shapes. See what emerges!
- When you're done, document everything by photographing or scanning your work. Write a short reflection (nothing too intense) about your process: What encoding systems worked best? How did changing visual variables affect the "feel" of the same data? What surprised you about translating numbers into visual form?

**Due:** 25th 10pm

## Day 3: Central Tendencies

Today we're diving into how you compare to the statistical "average Indian" using the National Time Use Survey.

- I'll provide you with highlights from the National Time Use Survey of India. This massive survey tracks how people across the country spend their time - sleeping, working, scrolling Instagram, and everything in between.
- For one full day, track your own time use. Be honest! Record your activities in 30-minute chunks, using the same categories as the national survey. Yes, include that 2-hour TikTok rabbit hole. Yes, include how long you spent deciding what to eat for lunch.
- Create visualizations that explore the following:
    1. You vs. The Average: How does your day compare to the national averages? Are you sleeping more or less? Spending more time on education? Less time on household chores?
    2. Demographic Divides: How do you compare specifically to people of your age group, gender, or region? Find at least one interesting comparison.
    3. The Odd One Out: Identify one area where you're significantly different from the norm. Visualize this disparity in a way that highlights just how unusual you are!
    4. What If...?: Create a speculative visualization showing "what if everyone in India followed my pattern?" What would change about our society? More Netflix? Less cooking? More studying?
- Write a short reflection on what surprised you about your time use compared to national patterns. Did you discover anything unexpected about yourself or about "average" Indian behavior?

This is about connecting the statistical thinking we discussed in class to your personal experience. And yes, it's also about discovering whether you're statistically weird or boringly normal!

## Day 4: Exploring Charting Tools


Now that we've cleaned our data and explored various encoding methods, it's time to put everything together and focus on what visualization is really about: generating _insights_!

- Choose one of your cleaned datasets from Assignment 4 (or a new dataset if you're feeling adventurous). This time, you're going to take it all the way from data to a polished visualization that reveals something interesting.
- Before diving into tools, spend some time with your data. What questions does it raise? What patterns might be hiding in there? What comparisons would be most meaningful? Jot down at least 3 potential "insight directions" you could explore.
- Create at least 2 different visualization approaches for your dataset using any techniques and tools we've covered so far. These should be substantially different from each other - not just color variations but different ways of looking at the same data. Think about:
    - Which visual forms best support this story?
    - How can I design this to make patterns immediately apparent?
- Implement your visualizations using any tool you'd like - Rawgraphs, Datawrapper or Flourish, or even drawing it in Figma or Illustrator (but you'll have be careful about how you're encoding values)!
- Write a short reflection comparing your two approaches. Which was more effective at revealing insights? Why? What did you learn about your data through this process? What would you do differently next time?

Due
## Day 5: Designs, Rules of Thumb and Critiques

### Assignment 6

Time for a visualization makeover challenge! We're about to dive into some real-world visualizations that could use some creative rethinking.

- In your assigned groups, dig into the EY report on India's media & entertainment sector: [EY Report Link](https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-in/insights/media-entertainment/documents/ey-in-india-s-media-entertainment-sector-is-innovating-for-the-future-03-2024-v3.pdf) (or alternatively, browse through Makeover Monday posts if you want to choose something different).
- Your first task is exploratory: spend time really _understanding_ what you're looking at. What story is each visualization trying to tell? What was the original author's intent? What data is being represented? Who is the audience? This contextual understanding is crucial before you start redesigning.
- As a group, select 2-3 visualizations from your chosen source that you think could be improved. For each one:
    - Document the strengths and weaknesses of the original
    - Extract or recreate the underlying data (you might need to estimate from the visuals)
    - Discuss multiple potential redesign approaches
    - Implement your best redesign idea
- In your redesigns, focus on:
    - Clarity: Does it communicate the key insights more effectively? More interestingly?
    - Honesty: Does it represent the data accurately without distortion?
    - Engagement: Does it draw viewers in and encourage them to learn more?
    - Context: Does it provide enough information for understanding?
- Prepare a brief group presentation that shows your "before and after" transformations, explaining your redesign decisions and how they improved the original visualization.

**Due:** 31st in class (group presentations)

**Submit:** Group slides showing original visualizations, your redesigns, and notes explaining your decisions

## Day 6: Stories, Case Studies, Notes

### Final Project Kickoff!

We've made it to the final project stage! This is your chance to bring together everything you've learned about visualization and apply it to a story _you_ want to tell.

- Meet with your group and start exploring potential questions or investigations for your final project. What's a dataset or topic that genuinely interests your team? What's a story that deserves visual exploration? Don't just pick something because it sounds academic - choose something that makes you curious.
- For today's submission, prepare a project proposal that includes:
    - Your key question or investigation focus
    - A description of your dataset(s) and what prep work they'll need
    - At least 3 rough sketches of potential visualization layouts
    - A moodboard of "north star" visualizations that inspire your approach
    - Most importantly: detailed notes on WHY these inspirations matter to your project (Is it their storytelling technique? Their visual style? Their clever use of interaction?)
- Be prepared to discuss your proposal in class - we'll be giving feedback and helping refine your direction.

**Due:** 1st April 10 AM

## Day 7 & 8

Continue developing the group infographic/visualization. Complete the data preparation and initial visualization drafts.

Refine the group project based on feedback received. Focus on improving clarity, visual appeal, and storytelling aspects.
