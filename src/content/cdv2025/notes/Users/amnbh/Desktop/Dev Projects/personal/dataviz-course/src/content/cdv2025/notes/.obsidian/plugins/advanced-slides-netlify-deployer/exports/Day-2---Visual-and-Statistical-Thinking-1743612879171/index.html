Or, a modest inquiry into why the mind prefers pictures to sums

**Session 2**</section><section>## Welcome back! 

Let us start by discussing some things from yesterday's activity. 

- How many of you recorded data digitally vs on paper? What were your challenges? <!--element class="fragment"-->
- While recording data, what was annoying? What did you have to deal with while collating the Google sheet? <!--element class="fragment"-->

<div class="fragment">

Data collection is a _hard_ activity. Put yourselves in the shoes of John Snow roaming the streets of Soho or Nightingale counting the dead at Scutari.

</div></section><section>The data we get to work with are rarely, if ever, in the format we need to do our analyses. It‚Äôs often the case that one tool requires data in one format, while another tool requires the data to be in another format. 

<br/>
To be efficient data-goblins, we should have good tools for _reshaping_ data for our needs so we can do our actual work like making plots.

We'll come back to our datasets, hang on to them for a bit.  <!--element class="fragment"--></section><section>## A note about the submissions

Yesterday, around 50% of the submissions were clearly ChatGPT generated. I've let you know my rules very clearly:

**I am extremely proud of the people who put time in!** 

Those that didn't, and I'm sure you know who you are, I'll be glad to come round to your submissions when it is written by **you**.

I hope we can spend the rest of our 9 days together learning and not worrying about the origins of your work.</section><section>> **"There is a magic in graphs."** <br/>

"Gen Alpha isn't spending anything on alchocol, they're killing the industry!!" <!--element class="fragment"--></section><section>A data visualization is useful only if it encodes information in a way that our eyes can perceive and our brain can understand.

When creating data visualizations, we're essentially translating abstract data into visual forms that our perceptual system can process effectively.</section><section>This translation happens through two fundamental components:

**Marks** are the basic geometric elements that represent our data objects or their relationships.

**Channels** are the visual properties we assign to these marks to encode data values. They control how the marks appear visually and carry meaning.


A successful visualization uses appropriate combinations that make patterns and relationships immediately apparent to viewers without requiring excessive cognitive effort.</section><section>## The eyes have it

When we look at a line chart, or notice a number in a dashboard, we use our working memory to store just the information we need at the moment. This type of memory breaks the entire visual into small chunks of information, in a process appropriately called ‚Äòchunking.‚Äô Surprisingly, for all the complexity of our brain, our working memory can hold only about 3 chunks of information at any given time. 


note: Let‚Äôs say we walk into a supermarket to buy oranges. Our eyes first scan the layout of the supermarket.
At the same time, our brain processes the various sections of the layout, and instructs the eyes to zone
in on the fruits section. It does this by sending signals about how fruits look from memory. The eyes then
break the entire scanned area into parts, and scans each part to spot the fruits section. The same process
is repeated till we zero in on the oranges in the fruits section. This process of visualizing information is
performed by the eyes and memory working in parallel.</section><section>## Pre-attentive attributes

These attributes are what immediately catch our eye when we look at a visualization. They can be perceived in less than 10 milliseconds, even before we make a conscious effort to notice them.</section><section>![[IMG-20250325011442554.png]] <!--element class="fragment fade-in-then-out"-->

From your survey responses from yesterday, everyone choose some questions and their answers that they want to visualize. 

- Your visualizations should go on one side of the sheet, and a legend on the other. 
- Remember that your visualization + legend **need to stand on their own!** Giorgia and Stefanie couldn't go there to explain stuff to each other. 
- Try to incorporate as much fun detail and nuance from your surveys. Is there something fun that came up while you interviewed people? Try to include that too.

If you have quantitative data, then the data can be either continuous or discrete. 

**Discrete data have finite values**, or buckets. You can count them. 

Continuous data _could_ have an infinite number of values, which forms 'a continuum'.

If you find yourself saying "number of...", thats a discrete value. Here are some examples of discrete and continuous data.

- **Strategy:** Find three players whose OBPs add up to 3 * .477 = 1.431. Then, when you divide that sum by 3, you get the target average.

The key is that he's using the concept of the average to _plan_ and _predict_ the collective outcome of a group of players.

The _Moneyball_ example focuses on **achieving a target average by combining multiple values**.

- Most commonly used measure 
- Significantly influenced by outliers 
- Example: In {3,5,6,7,7,9,8,7,5,6,4,5,3,1}, the mean is 5.43 

</div> <div class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="2"> 

### Median
The **middle value** 
- Data must be arranged in order 
- Particularly useful for skewed distributions 
- Stable with unusually large/small values 
- Example: In {1,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,7,8,9}, the median is 5.5 
</div> <div class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" data-fragment-index="3"> 
### Mode
The **most frequent value** 
- Shows what value occurs most often 
- Can have multiple modes (bimodal, multimodal) 
- Doesn't necessarily represent the center 
- Example: In {3,5,6,7,7,9,8,7,5,6,4,5,3,1}, the mode is 7

Please open **Orange**.</section><section>The interface is very simple:

![[IMG-20250325005926326.png]]
<br/>

1. Main drawing pane
2. Data import functions
3. Transform functions</section><section>Drag the 'Datasets' widget into the drawing window. 

![[IMG-20250325112322856.png]]</section><section>Select `Adult Census Income`.

![[IMG-20250325112402789.png]]</section><section>Connect it to the `FEATURE STATISTICS` widget (from the Transform pane). What are the variables here?

![[IMG-20250325005926347.png]]

note:- Dataset length: How many rows/observations?
- Dataset breadth: How many columns/variables?
- How many Quant variables?
- How many Qual variables?
- Quant variables: min, max, mean, median, sd
- Qual variables: levels, counts per level
- Both: means, medians for each level of a Qual variable‚Ä¶</section><section>![[IMG-20250325005926360.png]]</section><section>## What is the mean age WITHIN an occupation?

Introducing `GROUP BY`! Whenever you feel like you need to get the measure of a `Quantitative` variable **across** another `Qualitative` variable, you will use `GROUP BY`.</section><section>In the transform pane, fine 'GROUP' and add it to your drawing pane. 

![[IMG-20250325005926376.png]]

Connect it to your input data</section><section>Orange has this annoying habit of selecting EVERYTHING when you first open the `GROUP` widget. **Unselect all aggregations**. 

![[IMG-20250325005926390.png|600]]</section><section>![[IMG-20250325005926404.png]]

WHAT!? We went from 48,800 rows of data to 14! <!--element class="fragment"-->

TIP: Use `CMD` or the `Windows` key to select two or more `GROUP BY` variables <!--element class="fragment"--></section><section>![[IMG-20250325005926417.png]]</section><section>Time to meet our first chart...

|What It Is|Description|
|---|---|
|**Basic Idea**|Shows numbers as bars. Longer bars = bigger numbers|
|**Parts**|‚Ä¢Has a category<br>‚Ä¢ Each bar shows one number|
