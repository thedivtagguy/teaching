# The Unreasonable ~Effectiveness~ Trickiness of Tinkering

### I've been thinking a lot about how to structure this talk.

The lightning answer is: 
### Side projects; do them! End of talk, thank you for coming. 

But every time I say that, I feel like I'm ignoring how hard it actually is when you start. <!-- element class="fragment" -->
 
notes: That seems fairly obvious, no one ever said no to wanting to learn more or have more to show for, so its not like no one wants to something good for themselves. Every time I say that to someone, though, I feel like I'm saying something without realizing how hard it can be. 


---

So today I'll tell you about <strong class="highlight"> what I used to do wrong </strong>  when I first started doing side-projects and how I've learnt.

In a place like this, we all appear <span class="rainbow-hello"> perfectly curated </span> but things are rarely as smooth as they may seem. 

notes: The truth is that doing _any_ side project means being your own product manager, designer, developer, analyst, copywriter, social media manager and client-calmer-downer. 

You are the client, you have mood swings and it's your job to keep things running smoothly. And that can be a tough thing to balance.

None of this would exist if I hadn't learned to stop failing in the same predictable ways. 

notes: Now let me tell you about the mistakes that used to kill every project I started...

---

### Mistake #1
## Thinking My Idea Isn't Big Enough

I used to ask "Is this idea important enough? Will anyone care?" Wrong questions.

Better question: "Will I learn something new? Do I care enough to finish it?" <!--element class="fragment"-->

Rhea and I turned our daily Wordle fights into an `R/Shiny` project that's been running 1.5 years. 

Not world-changing, but I learned how to build a dashboard and we have something fun to show for our arguments.

Be selfish and bring something into existence that you (and maybe two-three of your friends) would like to see and use. 

Big, small, who cares?

notes: Over the past year, I've been lucky enough to create a few publicly useful projects that were widely used and viewed, but neither of those were created for the _purpose_ of being publicly-useful.

### Mistake #2
## Relying on Motivation

</div>

<div>

The dopamine hit from your brilliant idea lasts about 3 days. Then reality hits - debugging, design decisions, that feature that seemed easy but isn't.

Projects never go as planned. Accept this early, and focus on completing what's actually possible.

</div>
</split>

---

Here's the result of dopamine withdrawal.

![[IMG-20250626033349457.jpeg|600]]

notes: why bother working on something that is going nowhere?


---

My solution was to **treat it like a job I chose** rather than relying on motivation.

Schedule it like a meeting with yourself. Same time, same days, no negotiation.

notes: Inspiration is useful, but it's fleeting or at best inconsistent. The sooner you stop relying on inspiration to last, the sooner you'll learn to find other ways of motivating yourself.

Challenges like Tidytuesday, 30 Day Chart/Map Challenge, and the other _dozens_ of community activities are GREAT for getting into a rhythm!!

notes: They keep you accountable, provide you ideas and you mostly don't need to rely on motivation to get through.

### Mistake #3
## Shiny Object Syndrome

If you're starting off like I was 4 years ago, it can seem like there is a lot to learn!


Which framework? Which language? Which tool!!?!?? I spent more time choosing tools than building anything.

<div>

<span class="highlight">Pick tools and stick with them. </span>You'll grow into more complex work naturally, but jumping 
between shiny things kills momentum. 

Your "small blob" work isn't wasted because it compounds.

notes: You start off like small and keep growing as you learn to handle things your size but always growing. Thankfully, technology work grows with you, and no amount of 'small blobs' go waste.

I've been trying to get better at tracking myself through "live" viz with the same tools for the past 4 years...

### Mistake #4
## Working in isolation

<split even gap="2">

<div>

The best stuff I've made happened when I stopped being precious about "my vision", asking for help and finding someone else who makes things, even if it's completely different from what you do.

### Mistake #5
## Waiting for perfection

 Many projects are never "finished". You'll always have more to add, and that's ok. 
 
 
 You can keep adding, but don't let that hinder taking a break or showing version 1 to the world. Recognizing "good enough" is important.

For collaborative projects, having someone to bounce off off is super nice.

### BUT, I'm extremely privileged. 

 <u> I have the incredible luxury of time. </u>

notes: I'm a single guy, who has people to help with cooking and cleaning, working from home, no family to take care of where I live, with enough time on his hands to do this everyday. Not everyone's like that. Some people use their weekends to work their jobs, take care of family or for a break; not side projects.

### Do what you can. A tinyletter newsletter, a short blog, a doodle, a chart a day, a Tidytuesday, a Blender donut is enough! 

<br/>

You don't need to be technical or devote tons of time. Make something small you can point to and say "I built that." Everything else grows from there.
