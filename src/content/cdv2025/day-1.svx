# Day 1: Introduction to Computer Science

## Overview

Welcome to **cdv2025: Introduction to Computer Science**! In this first class, we'll cover the course syllabus, expectations, and introduce basic programming concepts.

<div class="important">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Please make sure to complete the environment setup before the next class. This will ensure you can follow along with the coding examples.</p>
</div>

## Key Topics

Our first session will introduce fundamental concepts that will form the foundation for the entire course:

- Course overview and expectations
- What is Computer Science?
- History of computing
- Introduction to algorithms
- Basic programming concepts
- Setting up your development environment

## What is Computer Science?

Computer Science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computers themselves are just tools; the real essence of CS is problem-solving.

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Computer Science is not just about programming. It encompasses a wide range of topics including algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>
</div>

### The Computational Thinking Process

Computational thinking involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Looking for similarities among problems
3. **Abstraction**: Focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant details
4. **Algorithms**: Developing step-by-step solutions

## Introduction to Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. We'll be studying various algorithms throughout this course and understanding their efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>What makes a good algorithm?</summary>
  <p>A good algorithm should be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Correct</strong>: It should solve the problem it was designed to solve</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient</strong>: It should use computational resources wisely</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong>: It should be easy to understand and implement</li>
    <li><strong>Finite</strong>: It should terminate after a finite number of steps</li>
  </ul>
</details>

### Example Algorithm: Finding the Maximum

Here's a simple algorithm to find the maximum value in a list:

1. Start with the first number as the current maximum
2. Compare each number in the list to the current maximum
3. If a number is larger than the current maximum, update the maximum
4. Return the maximum value after checking all numbers

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a "Hello, World" program in Python, the programming language we'll be using throughout this course:

```python
# This is a comment - it's ignored by the computer
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints text to the screen
```

<div class="warning">
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Case matters in programming! <code>Print()</code> is not the same as <code>print()</code>.</p>
</div>

## Programming Concepts

Let's briefly look at some basic programming concepts we'll explore in more depth:

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Variables | Named storage locations | `name = "Alice"` |
| Data Types | Categories of data | `numbers, strings, booleans` |
| Control Flow | Decision making and loops | `if, else, for, while` |
| Functions | Reusable code blocks | `def greet(name): ...` |

## Setting Up Your Environment

For this course, you'll need to install:

1. **Python 3.x**: The programming language we'll use
2. **Visual Studio Code**: A code editor with helpful features
3. **Git**: Version control for tracking changes

## Next Class Preparation

For our next session, please:
1. Read Chapter 1 of our textbook
2. Install the required software (Python and VSCode)
3. Try writing your first "Hello, World" program
